# 3. Fishery management plan objectives and conceptual models

This report's indicator selection process sought to select indicators that corresponded to the island based fishery management plan (FMP) objectives in order to track performance, and also selected indicators related to risks to meeting these management objectives. The following figure shows indicators selected per FMP objective. Indicators were also sourced and considered from the conceptual model exercise completed by the Council's Science and Statistical Committee and District Advisory panels, which began in 2019. Top scored connections in ecosystem components were considered in the ESR indicator suite as well (Rivera et al, in publication).
