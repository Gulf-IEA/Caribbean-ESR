The purpose of this report is to synthesize ecosystem and socioeconomic information to help the CFMC better meet fishery management objectives. This report relied on both previously identified proposed indicators as well as expert vetting to select a suite of indicators that best address the fishery management plan (FMP) objectives for the U.S. Caribbean. Information in this report is organized into two sections: tracking performance toward fishery management objectives and potential risks to meeting fishery management objectives. The style of this report is based on the 2023 State of the Ecosystem Reports for the Northeast U.S. Shelf.",

Report structure\nThe CFMC’s Science and Statistical Committee, as well as the region’s Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management Technical Advisory Panel (EBFM TAP), recently completed a series of conceptual models linking key components of the ecosystem and human activities related to fishing. This report used these conceptual models as a starting list of proposed indicators and matched the indicators to answer FMP objectives when possible. For those objectives that did not have an immediate conceptual model-identified indicator, this report used a decision matrix process for expert vetting (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Process for selecting indicators for the U.S. Caribbean Ecosystem Status Report\n\n\n\nThis decision matrix was composed of a list of proposed indicators compiled from the conceptual models as well as proposed indicators provided via expert input. These potential indicators were vetted and edited by expert small working groups, who then scored a decision matrix (Figure 2.2) of potential indicators against the following decision criteria: long term data availability, measurability, sensitivity to environmental changes, specificity, spatial and temporal scalability, relevance to specific FMP objectives, and responsiveness to management actions.",

The x-axis represents the temporal dimension, which may be monthly, yearly, or irregular time steps, and the y-axis represents the indicator value in units specified in the axis label. The dashed horizontal line represents the mean indicator value across the entire time series, and the solid horizontal lines denote the mean plus or minus one standard deviation. Red shaded areas and green shaded areas show years for which the indicator value is below or above one standard deviation from the mean, respectively. The blue vertical shaded box highlights the last five years of indicator values, over which additional metrics are calculated. Black circles to the right of each figure indicate whether the indicator values over the last five years are greater (plus sign), less than (minus sign), or within (solid circle) one standard deviation from the mean of the overall time series. Arrows to the right of each figure indicate whether the least squares linear fit through the last five years of data produces a positive or negative slope that is greater than one standard deviation (upward or downward arrows respectively), or less than one standard deviation (left-right arrow).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Example time series plot, showing an indicator plotted with its mean and standard deviation, and trend analysis for the most recent five years of data.

    "text": "Degree heating weeks\nThe degree heating week (DHW) provides a measure of cumulative temperature anomalies at least 1°C above the maximum monthly mean sea surface temperature over the prior twelve-week period for a given satellite data grid point (5km pixel). Both the intensity and duration of the heat stress impact the DHW, which is measured in units of “degree Celsius-weeks’’ (or °C-weeks). The DHW data presented below is for the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Daily 5km Regional Virtual Stations. The Regional Virtual Stations provide a time series of DHW data that is representative of the whole region’s thermal conditions. Briefly, the reef pixels within a region are identified based on the most updated maps of coral reef locations, and a 20 km buffer around these reef areas is added as a boundary for the virtual station. The DHW value for the virtual station is based on the 90th percentile Coral Bleaching Hotspot value (i.e., the number of degrees Celsius above the maximum monthly mean sea surface temperature). Field observations of coral bleaching have indicated that a DHW value of 4°C-weeks can lead to significant coral bleaching, while a DHW value of 8°C-weeks or above can likely lead to severe, widespread bleaching and substantial mortality. The monthly mean DHW value is plotted below for the Puerto Rico and Virgin Island virtual stations. An increasing trend was seen for both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the last five years. Peak number of degree heating weeks with value more than one standard deviation above the mean were seen in late 2005, late 2006, late 2010, and late 2019, reflecting times of most pressure on coral reef resources. Indeed, mass bleaching events were experienced in the U.S. Caribbean region in 2005, 2010 and 2019 (see observed coral bleaching indicator).
