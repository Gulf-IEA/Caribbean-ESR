## ESR Lab Reports

ESR lab reports are quarto books that compile the R scripts for each indicator as well as any other descriptions of how the ESR will be put together.

## Caribbean ESR

This lab report is for the Caribbean ESR that was compiled from 2023-2024. This is the first ESR for the Caribbean region. Here we can add more text about why this ESR is being compiled.

## Some notes

This lab report was created the following way:

1.  clone the Caribbean ESR repo into my R studio
2.  create a new folder in the repo called "Lab report"
3.  create 2 files, one called "index.qmd" and abother called "_quarto.txt" within the Lab report folder
4.  rename the "_quarto.txt" file to "_quarto.yml" in file explorer to change it into the book YAML
5.  populate the YAML document 

Note: this works great for rendering the quarto book as an html file. I can't figure out how to render it as a pdf though. This is not really necessary for the lab report but something to keep in mind.
